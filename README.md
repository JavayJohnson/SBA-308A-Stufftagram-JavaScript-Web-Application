Stufftagram - The Social Network for Inanimate Objects 

 Welcome to Stufftagram, the only social media spot where your favorite things come alive and get their shine on! Whether you’re an analog phone serving serious sass, a toaster getting that morning pop, or a laptop on that “I need a break” vibe, Stufftagram is where your story gets told!
